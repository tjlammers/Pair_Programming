# 🚧 Pair Programming with Flask Assignment 🐍

Welcome to our work-in-progress assignment on pair programming with Flask! In this project, we're collaborating to build a Flask web application using Python, with a focus on pair programming practices. Let's dive in and see what we're working on! 🛠️

## 🤝 Pair Programming Partners
We are Trevor Lammers and David Powers and we created this form as well as an about section for BAIS:3300.


## 📝 Assignment Overview

The goal of this assignment is to develop a Flask web application that can predict your salary using Ai based on a variety of factors. The form contains information about your age, gender, country, degree, coding experience, current title, and the size of the company. You will fill out all of this information using drop down boxes and then submit the form. 
. We'll be working together in pairs, following the principles of pair programming to enhance collaboration, code quality, and learning.
